1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company that developed a game called Draw It or Lose It for Android. They tasked us with designing a web-based version of the game to support cross-platform functionality. The software needed to be scalable, support multiplayer functionality, and maintain performance and consistency across different platforms.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I clearly communicated the system architecture and design components in a structured and professional format. I effectively outlined the use of the Singleton design pattern, design constraints, and how the software components would interact, making it easy for both technical team members and stakeholders to understand.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Creating the design document helped me plan out the architecture and flow of the application before writing any code. It forced me to think through system interactions, scalability, user interface expectations, and potential challenges. This made actual development smoother and more efficient.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one part, I would expand the Evaluation section to include a more detailed risk assessment and mitigation strategies. This would provide better foresight into potential issues related to user load, platform differences, and security.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on the gameplay experience across different devices, emphasizing consistency, responsiveness, and ease of access. It’s critical to design with the user in mind to ensure the final product meets their expectations, is intuitive to use, and supports a seamless gaming experience.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the design using an object-oriented methodology and emphasized modularity and reusability. I used UML diagrams to visualize class relationships and applied design patterns like Singleton to handle resource management. In future projects, I would incorporate additional user testing and wireframing earlier in the design phase to validate assumptions before development begins.
